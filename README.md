# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-SQL
This project presents an in-depth SQL-based analysis of pizza sales data to uncover meaningful insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends.
By writing and executing SQL queries on a relational database, the analysis focuses on:

📦 Order and revenue trends

🍕 Popular pizza sizes and types

📈 Sales distribution over time

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer preferences and behavior

The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions regarding marketing strategies, inventory planning, and menu optimization based on actionable insights extracted from the data.

📈 Analysis & Recommendations
🔍 Key Analysis
1.High Order Volumes on Weekends & Evenings
Orders peak during weekends and evenings, indicating strong customer engagement during leisure times.

2.Most Popular Size: Medium
Medium-sized pizzas were ordered the most — ideal for sharing, which suggests value-seeking behavior.

3.Top Performers by Revenue
A few premium pizzas (like Pepperoni Deluxe and BBQ Chicken) generate the highest revenue, even with fewer units sold — pointing to higher margins.

4.Category Insights
Classic and Deluxe categories dominate sales, while Veggie options show moderate performance.

5.Revenue Distribution
A small set of pizza types contributes disproportionately high revenue, showing an 80/20 rule pattern — 20% of items bring 80% of sales.

✅ Recommendations
1.Boost Popular Products with Combos
Create combo deals around best-selling medium pizzas to drive higher value and upselling.

2.Leverage High-Margin Pizzas in Promotions
Promote high-revenue pizzas (even with lower quantity) through premium deals or limited-time offers.

3.Optimize Weekend Operations
Increase staffing and inventory for weekends and evenings when demand surges.

4.Experiment with Underperforming Categories
Consider new toppings, pricing adjustments, or bundled deals to improve Veggie category performance.

5.Use Time-Based Campaigns
Introduce time-limited offers during off-peak hours to balance kitchen load and increase weekday sales.
