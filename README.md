The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions regarding marketing strategies, inventory planning, and menu optimization based on actionable insights extracted from the data.

📈 Analysis & Recommendations
🔍 Key Analysis
High Order Volumes on Weekends & Evenings
Orders peak during weekends and evenings, indicating strong customer engagement during leisure times.

Most Popular Size: Medium
Medium-sized pizzas were ordered the most — ideal for sharing, which suggests value-seeking behavior.

Top Performers by Revenue
A few premium pizzas (like Pepperoni Deluxe and BBQ Chicken) generate the highest revenue, even with fewer units sold — pointing to higher margins.

Category Insights
Classic and Deluxe categories dominate sales, while Veggie options show moderate performance.

Revenue Distribution
A small set of pizza types contributes disproportionately high revenue, showing an 80/20 rule pattern — 20% of items bring 80% of sales.

✅ Recommendations
Boost Popular Products with Combos
Create combo deals around best-selling medium pizzas to drive higher value and upselling.

Leverage High-Margin Pizzas in Promotions
Promote high-revenue pizzas (even with lower quantity) through premium deals or limited-time offers.

Optimize Weekend Operations
Increase staffing and inventory for weekends and evenings when demand surges.

Experiment with Underperforming Categories
